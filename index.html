                India's ODI World Cup 2023 Squad: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) selection panel
                headed by Ajit Agarkar,
                on Tuesday (September 5), announced a solid 15-member preliminary squad for ICC Men's ODI World Cup
                2023.
                The team management picked four all-rounders, four bowlers and seven batters for the mega event.
                Talented youngster Tilak Varma, pacer Prasidh Krishna and wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson are the three
                big names missing from
                India's ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023 official squad.

                fit and has completely recovered.

                A diabetic is constantly aware of what they eat. A diabetic must avoid refined sugar and carbohydrates

                They must also stock their kitchen pantry with whole grains and other essential herbal ingredients and

                might be called the OnePlus Pad Go. It might be likely that the Go edition might be a toned-down variant
                of the
                premium OnePlus Pad if it goes by the Android Go name scheme, which is a toned-down version of the
                regular Android operating system.
                OnePlus is yet to confirm the launch.</p>
